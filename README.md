# MySQL_Project
Utilizing MySQL to manipulate a database.

There are 10 different tasks that must be met in order to demonstrate my knowledge of manipulating the MySQL database workbench and the use of Python code.

#Function 1: In table “publisher”, there is already some data: A list of publisher IDs, names,
        # emails and phone numbers. Your program should print out all the data in this table.
#Function 2: Create a table customer (custID, custName, zip, city, state).
#Function 3: Insert 5 customers (‘ABRAHAM SILBERSCHATZ’, 'HENRY KORTH',
        # 'CALVIN HARRIS', 'MARTIN GARRIX' and ' JAMES GOODWILL'.) into table
        # “customer” with the custID, custName, zip, city and state. If you want to execute your
        # program multiple times and don’t want to see errors of trying to insert duplicate entries,
        # you may use “INSERT IGNORE INTO” statement, which will do nothing if there is
        # already the same entry in the table
#Function 4: Find the author who has written the most number of books.
#Function 5: List all the publishers and the total price of their published titles.
#Function 6: Find the names of all authors who have written a book in a subject that has the
        # word "Java" in its name.
#Function 7: Find the names of all authors who have written a book with a price between
        # than $475 and $500 and a cover type of "Paper back".
#Function 8: Write a query to retrieve the names of all authors who have written books on
        # the subject " VISUAL BASIC.NET " but have not written any books on the subject "
        # ORACLE DATABASE".
#Function 9: Write a query to retrieve the names of all whose email address contains the
        # domain "gmail.com".
#Function 10: Form a query to decrease the price of all the books published before 2003 by
        # 25% and decrease the price of all the books published after 2004 by 10%.
